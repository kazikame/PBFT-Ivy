# Practical Byzantine Fault-Tolerance in Ivy

## Check Abstract Model

1. Axioms cannot be compiled with the implementation and hence are commented out by default. Uncomment the axioms in `pbft_abstract_kv.ivy`.
2. Uncomment the exported actions situated at the end of the file.

To verify
```bash
ivy_check pbft_abstract_kv.ivy
```

A successful run should report `OK` in the end.
